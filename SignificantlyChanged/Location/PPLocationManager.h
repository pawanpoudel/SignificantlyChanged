    @discussion  Ideally, this method shouldn't be called at all because it
                 is a bad practice to ask for permission from areas in app
                 that do not use location at all. The user might get confused
                 as to why the app is asking for permission. That being said, 
                 this method provides an easy way to show the permission alert
